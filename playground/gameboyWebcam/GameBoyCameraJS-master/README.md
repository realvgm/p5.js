# GameBoyCameraJS

This is a simple project that emulate the GameBoy Camera aesthetic using JavaScript, p5.js, and your webcam. It applies the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm to achieve the pixelated style similar of the GameBoy.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration:** Captures live video feed from your webcam and applies the GameBoy Camera aesthetic in real-time.
- **Dithering Effect:** Implements the [Floyd-Steinberg Dithering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering) to simulate the pixelated, monochrome look.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) with webcam access.
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (included in the project)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdrianoMoura/GameBoyCameraJS
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Make sure to allow access to your webcam when prompted.

## Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start the webcam feed.
- The live video feed from your webcam will be processed to emulate the GameBoy Camera aesthetic.
- Click on the camera icon to capture an image
- Click on the arrows to change the color palette

## How It Works

This project uses p5.js to capture live video from your webcam and display it on the canvas. The Floyd-Steinberg Dithering algorithm is applied in real-time to create the characteristic look of the GameBoy Camera. The algorithm works by distributing quantization error across neighboring pixels, producing a dithering effect.
